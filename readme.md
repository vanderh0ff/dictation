# dictation

---------------

These programs were created to use free PDF spelling worksheets from a popular online homeschool curriculum k12reader, parse sentences that are designed to be read as dictation to students, and generate mp3 audio files to allow the students to complete the lessons on their own.

## how to use

edit `config.json` so that the value of `output_location` is the directory that the new mp3 files will go and `file_location` is the directory of the weekly spelling worksheet pdfs. then run dictation.py
